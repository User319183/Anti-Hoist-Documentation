# Anti-Hoist-Documentation

**Welcome to the Anti-Hoist documentation**

This is a simple version of how to use our Discord bot, Anti-Hoist.


**How to bypass & unbypass users:**

To let people hoist their names, it's pretty simple, just run the command `/bypass` and mention a user to ADD the bypass to themselves. To remove the bypass from that user, do the command `/unbypass` and mention a user to REMOVE the bypass. You will need the permission `manage_roles` for these commands.


**How to log if a user hoists themselves:**

Logging is also very easy! Just create the channel `antihoist-logs` and now you'll get notified when the bot finds someone with a hoisted name.


**How to make the bot detect nicknames pre-hoisted before the bot joins a server:**

This step is pre-built into the bot. When you kick & re-invite the bot, the bot should rename anyone with a hoisted nickname. If this doesn't work, please join our support server and report the issue in our support channel. The bot will `NOT` log when this happens due to much spam / API delay we will face.


**How to make the bot detect names pre-hoisted after the bot joins the server:**
Do the command `/remove_hoistednames` and your done! The bot will slowly change hoisted names. The bot will `NOT` log when this happens due to much spam / API delay we will face.
